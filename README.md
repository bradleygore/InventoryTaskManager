InventoryTaskManager
====================

Learning project for ASP.NET MVC, knockout.js, IOC with Ninject, AutoMapper, and other fun stuff


This is a utility that allows for tracking inventory items, grouped by categories, as well as tracking tasks and task lists.  You can have general tasks, or you can have tasks that are tied to an inventory item so that whenever you finish the task, your inventory item's quantity increases by the quantity specified in the task.  It was fun to build, as I explored some technologies I've not used before.
