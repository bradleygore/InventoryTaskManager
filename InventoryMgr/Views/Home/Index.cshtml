        Whether you're running a house or a business, keeping track of the 'stuff' you have
        is an important contributor to your success.  We offer a simple to use, yet effective, 
        utility to help do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Inventory module is a listing of all of your inventory items.  Each Inventory item 
        may have an associated Category, so items are easily grouped, and an associated Quantity Measurement.  
        You have full control over the Categories and Measurements you create, however there are a few standard 
        provided ones that are there to help you get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have a lot of flexibility when viewing your inventory.  You may view all categories even if no 
        items are associated, just to see what categories you have, or you can view only those categories 
        where inventory items are associated (this is the default behaviour).  You can create a new inventory 
        entry and assign to any cateogry you like, and you can update it afterwards to a different category.  You 
        can have as many or few categories and inventory items as you like.  If you have a ton of items to track, 
        maybe going with more categories that are specialized will be best, or if you just want to track the food 
        in the pantry you may not need as many.

        Our Task Lists module is a listing of all of your task lists.  Each task lists may contain as many tasks as you 
        like.  There is a lot of flexibility with the task lists, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Inventory Tasks</b> - An Inventory Task is a special task that's associated with a specific inventory item.  
            When you mark an Inventory Task as being complete, the quantity of your inventory item will increment by 
            the amount specified in your task!  The same applied when you un-complete a task, the quantity will decrement accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>General Tasks</b> - These are standard tasks that can be created that are not tied to inventory items, but may be handy to have 
            in the same task list as your inventory tasks.                
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Batch Task List Complete/Un-Complete</b> - When you mark any task list as being complete overall, this utility will go ahead and 
            mark all of the currently non-complete tasks within that list as having been complete.  This will increment your 
            inventory items that are associated with any inventory tasks that are affected.  However, when you un-complete 
            a task list, your tasks in the list won't be affected.  You are able to un-complete a inventory task that's associated with a completed task list, and your inventory item will decrement 
            appropriately.  This can be very handy for grocery lists, etc... where you may have 95% of your task list to complete.  It's faster 
            to complete them all and just un-complete the 5% that's not going to be addressed in this list rather than the other way around.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ability to control the tasks lists you see by viewing only ones not completed (default) or viewing them all.
        </li>        
    </ul>
